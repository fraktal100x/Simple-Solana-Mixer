# SOLmixer

SOLmixer is a tool to create multipe wallets and make linear transactions through all the wallets created, making it very tedious to trace the transactions back to the original wallet.

## Run these commands

- pnpm keygen - to create wallets
- pnpm check - to check balances
- pnpm mix - to make linear transactions
- pnpm recover - to recover the funds from the wallets if any is left, although the code already handles that so most likely you won't need to use this.

## Installation
pnpm install
